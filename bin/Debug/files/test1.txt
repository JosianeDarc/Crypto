From the Mariner evidence, researchers calculated Mercury must have decreased its radius by about 1-3km over its history.

But that figure was in conflict with modelling studies that suggested a cooling object like Mercury should have contracted much more in four billion years.

Messenger helps to resolve the inconsistency. Since entering into orbit in 2011, it has photographed 100% of the planet.

This has allowed for a more extensive study of the scarp features and the more subtle wrinkled ridges that also criss-cross its surface.

The new assessment now brings the observed shrinkage - a reduction in radius of 7km - into the realm expected by the models.
